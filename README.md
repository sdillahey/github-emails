# The Networker
## A simple Node app that utilizes the GitHub API to find the emails of GitHub users

To use you will need to fork, create a .env, npm install & npm start - it's that easy!

Create a top-level .env file which will just have `GITHUB_TOKEN=` with your personal access token which you can create <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">here</a>.

Happy Networking!

As always, let me know if you have any questions or ideas for improvements!
